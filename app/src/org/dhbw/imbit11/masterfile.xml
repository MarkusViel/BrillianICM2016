			Make sure that the goals and activities are in line with the
			objectives of the project. Everything in project management relies on
			the communication within the team. Our communication strategy focuses
			on relaying the project's objectives and goals.
			<br />
			Regarding time concerns, we will implement enough time buffer within

			<br />
			Communication takes too much time and is not needed at all since the
			goals, milestones and activities are clearly defined from the

		<content>
			Hello everyone!
			<br />
			<br />
			Welcome to our first steering committee meeting. I am glad that all
			of you found the time to be present today. As this is our first
			steering committee meeting I will briefly summarize the purposes and
			goals of this meeting and explain the agenda for today and the next
			meetings. All key managers of the project come together and control
			the realization of the project at the strategic level. This is where
			we verify the project’s coherence with established aims, and whether
			the project keeps established frames such as range, costs and
			deadlines. All high-level decisions for the project should be
			discussed and approved during these meetings. We will come together
			on a monthly basis and also in between if necessary. Again I am glad
			that everyone is here and that we have Avi on the phone.

		<content>Ok, then let’s go over the agenda quickly. In the following
			meetings we will start going over the minutes of the previous
			meeting, to remind us again of what has happened until then and to
			obtain everyone’s approval. As our last meeting was the kickoff
			meeting, we won’t go over the minutes today. In the following we will
			discuss the action list we composed in the last meeting. Afterwards I
			will give a status report on the project, presenting what has been
			achieved since the last meeting, announcing the upcoming tasks and
			illustrating the issues. We continue by discussing the current issues
			and decide on how to handle potential problems and how to proceed.
			After that there is time to announce and discuss any other subjects
			that you want to discuss with the steering committee. So that was the
			agenda. Are there any questions? </content>

			presentation today for two reasons: firstly, I will have to
			leave in 15 minutes to attend a meeting with a major client, and
			secondly, the main reason why I called you in today is to discuss the
			events that happened over the last couple of weeks. As some of you
			might know, we did run into some troubles with our colleagues from
			India. Earlier in this phase of the project I asked %gender%
			%surname% to call Mr. Gupta to inquire about the current status of
			his and his colleagues work. It turned out that the programming
			progress was drastically delayed at the time which required quick
			strategic changes. %gender% %surname%, can you please explain the
			situation? </content>
		<option href="l630e001"> Thank you for the introduction, Ms. Oaks, and
			hello to all of you from my side as well. I don’t want to take too
			much of your time, so I will just say there were some problems but we
			managed to fix them. I believe that our actions are to the best of
			our interests and I would like to pass the word back to Ms. Oaks.
